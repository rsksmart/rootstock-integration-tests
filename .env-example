# Amount of time in milliseconds for the `waitForBlock` utility function to wait.
# Configurable because depending on the resources of the machine the tests are running on, the wait time might change.
# In a machine with little resources (CPU, RAM, disk), a small wait time might not be enough because blocks can be mined slow and  `waitForBlock`
# might fail with a message like `Block number 800 never reached, last seen was 600`, or `Blockchain not advancing after attempting to  find a new block 80 times checking every 200 milliseconds.
# Couldn't reach block number 800. Last block number seen was: 600`.  In a machine with enough resources having a high wait time might be a waste of time since the tests would run slower because if this wait time.
# In this case, it can be set to a small value. `200` recommended for most machines with enough resources. `500`, `600`, etc., or more for machine with limited resources.
# Adjust as needed, starting with low values so the tests run as fast as they can.

# Max attempts for the `waitForBlock` utility function to 'wait' for the given block, trying to find that block once every `WAIT_FOR_BLOCK_ATTEMPT_TIME_MILLIS`.
# The same as the `WAIT_FOR_BLOCK_ATTEMPT_TIME_MILLIS` variable, the value for this variable could be updated depending on the machine the tests are running on.
# `80` recommended for most machines with enough resources. `160`, `250` or more for machine with limited resources.
